This Model helps in Tracking the CARBON FOOTPRINT with machine learning model.
We have also Integrated it with Quantum Machine  Learning Model so that it give more precise and actual values for CARBON EMISSION.

Requirement to run this :
1. Basic Knowledge of ML
2. Basic Knowledge Of QML
3. Use Google Colab

ALL THE INSTALLATION AND OTHER REQUIREMENT FOR THE RUNNING THIS MODEL HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE Carbon_Footprint_Tracker.ipynb file
